## Project Overview

The project we're working on is all about solving the Schrödinger equation, which is a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. Essentially, it helps us understand the behavior of particles (like atoms and molecules) at the smallest, quantum level.

To explain it simply, imagine you have a ball that you're trying to understand. The Schrödinger equation tells us about the different ways the ball can move and where it's most likely to be found. In our case, instead of a ball, we're looking at the behavior of the tiny building blocks of matter, like electrons.

# Key Components

1. Radial Equation: This part of the Schrödinger equation helps us understand how the probability of finding an electron changes as you move outward from the center of an atom. Imagine an atom as a tiny solar system, with the nucleus at the center and the electrons orbiting around it. The radial equation tells us about the likelihood of finding an electron at different distances from the nucleus.

2. Orbital Shapes: The solutions to the Schrödinger equation also reveal the different shapes that the electron's probability distribution can take, like spheres (s orbitals), dumbbells (p orbitals), and more complex shapes (d and f orbitals). These shapes are really important for understanding how atoms and molecules interact with each other.

# Visualization

To help visualize these concepts, our project includes functions that can generate 3D plots of the electron probability distributions for different types of orbitals. For example:

* The 1s orbital looks like a smooth, spherical  cloud around the nucleus.

* The 2p orbital has a dumbbell-like shape, with two distinct lobes.

* The 3d orbital has an even more complex shape, with multiple lobes and a more intricate structure.

By seeing these shapes, we can better understand how electrons behave within atoms and how atoms can form bonds to create molecules.
